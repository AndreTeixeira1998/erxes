**Activate your skills on your messenger**

How to use the Skill Based Routing?

Skill-based routing is a feature used with the erxes Messenger. Moreover, it makes conversations easier since each member can be assigned to a conversation automatically based on their skills. For example, if the operator deals with people with different languages there's a possibility to create a Language Skill Type and add the list of languages that are needed. Also, the person with the German language will be assigned to the person that chose German as an option. 

Here are the steps to activate the Skills-Based Routing : 

1. To use the Skill Based Routing the permission must be given. Please go to Settings -> Permission and add Skills Permissions. 
2. Go to Settings -> Skills and create a Skill Type. And add skills and attach them to the Skill Types. Moreover, the team members with that certain Skill must be added as well in the team members box.
3. To show the skill type on your erxes Messenger please turn on the "Show Skill In Messenger" by going to your erxes Messenger integration and you'll be allowed to choose from the Skills that you created.
 
:::caution

Please keep in mind that when a skill type is deleted all of the skills in that skill type will be also deleted.

:::
 
4. When you delete a certain skill the conversations that were related to that skill won't be deleted.
5. The team member can only see the conversations that he/she was assigned to certain skills.
6. All of the messages that didn't have any skills will be seen by all of the team members. 
7. SaaS/Open Source users should log out once and log in before using the Skill-Based Routing.
