**How to manage your tasks like a pro with Card Properties and Segments?**
In this article, we'll cover card property and segmentation practices for better task management.

You can segment your Task Cards and customize your pipeline filters. You can do this with custom properties or, for example, identify the deals that need attention by segmenting with the date when you last modified or changed the stage of the card.

1. Overall Structure of Tasks
In erxes, Sales Pipeline, Tasks, and Tickets have the same Kanban view as the default. But the intention behind these features is different. For example, it is recommended to use the Sales Pipeline for any sales-related activities as you can add products and services to these Deal Cards, and it has the sales conversion view. Task feature is designed to help you track your internal day-to-day activities across the entire organization. The Ticket feature works with the upcoming Client Portal feature, where your end-customers can create tickets themselves.

In Your Task Management has the following structure:

---

1.1 Boards, Pipelines, Stages

You can structure your Boards as your Departments, Brands, or anything that is the overarching theme of your entire workflow. Next up, your Pipelines could be arranged by fiscal year, project, location names, etc. As for Stages, you can name these stages according to your business characteristics.

For example, a digital marketing and web design company task structure could look like this:
Board: Product Management

Pipeline #1: Web Design
- Planning
- Designing
- Design Approved
- Developing
- Client Feedback  
- Testing  
- Approved  
- Maintenance

Pipeline #2: General
- Backlog
- To-Do
- Doing
- Waiting on Someone
- Deferred
- Done
1.2 Card Details

Once you have your Boards and Pipelines set up, now it is time to move on to the Cards. You can start managing your cards and 'groom' your pipelines with card details:

---

Here are some examples of Labels:
- Generic: working on it, stuck, waiting on someone, done
- Collaborative: drafting, reviewing, approval required
- Task type for a Content team: blog post, video, social media
- Task type for a Product Development team: bug, enhancement, new feature, infrastructure, etc.

2. Task Management
Aside from the essential task management functionalities, such as assigning team members and due dates, leaving notes, etc., you can create your custom properties and filters for your cards. This way, you can fully customize and implement a task management practice that works for you. Once you have your task card properties set, you can mix different default and custom properties to:

- Organize your tasks
- Identify certain tasks (items that need to be reviewed or archived)
- Prioritize initiatives
2.1 Organize Tasks with Custom Properties

To create Task Segments, please go to Settings -> Segments and click on Tasks.

You can create Custom Properties for your task cards such as:

- Number input type of property to measure Effort, Impact, etc.
- Dropdown type of property to track a commonly used attribute such as Phase, Branch Location, Objective, etc.
- 'Yes/No' single choice properties to identify Importance, Urgency, Difficulty, etc.

---
Here is how it will look like in the Card detail:

2.2 Identify Tasks with Segments

With Card Segments, you are essentially creating more in-depth filters for your pipelines. The default filters are:
- By team members (created or assigned)
- By priority
- By labels
- By customers/companies
- By due dates

But with Cards Segments, you can use any of these default properties to create your own filters:
- By date created, stage changed, modified (any changes in the card detail), due.
- By card name and description (i.e., filtering cards that contain a certain word)
- By team member who created and/or modified
- By team member who is assigned or is following the card updates
- Here is an example of how your Task Segments could look like with the default properties:

---
Let's take a closer look at the Segments related to dates. Here is the set up of the Segment which filters Content related tasks that were moved between stages within the last 15 days:

---
Before choosing the filters, we recommend choosing the Board and the Pipeline you wish to segment. Please note that your segment will not show up in that pipeline if you don't choose them.

- Status refers to the state of the card, whether it's active or archived. If you wish to filter only active cards, you should include this filter.
- The Label can be used if you wish to filter cards with a certain label in that pipeline. Once you choose the pipeline above, it will give you a dropdown of available labels in that specific pipeline.
- The Stage changed date refers to the date when the card was moved between stages.
1. In this case, we are using the 'date relative greater than' operator.
2. In the value field, you can either type in
- a set date, such as 2021-09-30
- a relative date, such as 'now-15d/d'. 'Now' refers to the present date and time. '15d/d' refers to 15 days. In this case, this filter will segment any tasks whose stage was changed on any day 15 days from today in the past, i.e., within the last 15 days.
- 
Let's take another example with dates. Here we have the filters used for segmenting older cards:

---
Here we are using the 'Created at' default property with the 'date relative less than' operator. In the value section, we wrote 'now-90d/d.' With this filter, you will see the total number of archived or active cards created more than 3 months ago. For segments with a relative date filter, it helps to visualize the dates on a linear scale.

If the relative date segments are confusing for you, you can always use set dates. In the case above, you could always write '2020-12-31' in the value field to filter cards created last year.

2.3 Prioritize Tasks with Segments

You can read about the importance of maintaining your to-do list and prioritization methods here. You can use the default Priority property to filter your cards:

---

But if you wish to customize your priority cards, you can use Card Segments. Once you decide which prioritization method you would like to use, you can easily create simple segments with your custom properties. Here, I have two methods created as Segments:

---

To prioritize cards with the abovementioned custom properties, you can set up individual segments like this. In this case, it is the Eisenhower Matrix:

---

Here is the finished prioritization filter:

**How to use the Segments feature for email sequences?**

Learn how to effectively setup email sequences with erxes segments.

The Segments feature helps you to filter, target, and engage a certain group of contacts. The Segments are used in the Contacts and Engage features. The Custom Properties are also useful when you create your segments.

In this article, you'll learn how to create a complete sequence of emails.

**Step 1:** Create a parent segment

First, you need to decide what type of contact you'll be working with. Currently, all new contacts are either labeled as Visitor or Lead, unless you manually update the state to Customer.

---

Creating a parent segment is useful if you wish to add another requirement (property) in this whole sequence instead of adding it individually to all subsegments. For example, you can add the "email validation = equals = valid" rule on to the parent segment.


**Step 2:** Create subsegments

1. Click on "New Segment"
2. Choose the parent segment
3. Create a subsegment with these parameters:

---

**Step 3:** Prepare your email content

You can create a simple content straight from the email editor in the Engage feature. Or you can create an Email Template, if you're working with an email content that is going to be continuously used.

**Step 4:** Create a new message with Engage

1. Go to Engage feature
2. Choose Auto Message
3. Select Email
4. Choose your segment
5. Choose "Every Day" in the Schedule
