Ticketboard is a powerful plugin that helps you to manage your customer inquiries a little easier for you and your clients. Our ticketing system allows you to track and manage your customer requests from creation to resolution. With ticket plugin, you can set the terms and conditions of your service and add inquiries for clients/customers to make when they find something wrong or want to modify something. This makes it easy for everyone involved by allowing them to know what is going on in their project.

### With Tickets, you can do...

- **Organize high volumes of requests in a centralized system**
One of the most obvious advantages is the ability to organize and catalog all incoming support queries with one thread. This is especially critical for businesses having to deal with high volumes of requests. 

- **Maintain customer service standards**
Many ticketing systems come with the ability to incorporate Service Level Agreements. SLAs help to set clear expectations for customers; providing clarity about when they can expect to receive a response. 

- **Improved communication with customers**
With all the interactions being limited to one shared location; ticket management systems make it easier for both customers and service agents to communicate with each other as well as having to analyse the queries, so that process can be improved.

- **Easy and efficient team collaboration**
Ticketing systems promote greater cooperation between the members of your customer support team using a number of collaboration features such as transferring and escalating tickets to senior team members, internal messaging capabilities, adding private notes to tickets that are visible only to agents, and more.

If your organization does not have many inquiries, creating a single pipeline would be beneficial. As you can organize different deals/tickets in the Label or Properties section of the pipeline, it may be more convenient for similar requests to be on one board. This saves time as it reduces time spent navigating around multiple screens as everything is sorted and funneled into one page.
