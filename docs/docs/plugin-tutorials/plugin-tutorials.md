erxes is composed of 2 main components: XOS & Plugins


### erxes XOS


It contains the project's core, or I would say the infrastructure of the erxes software. You can find the admin panel and the code that runs different plugins. The operating system has default utility features that allow users to customize, improve speed, and enhance the experience when using choices plugins/features.

Technically you can not do anything with erxes XOS on its own without plugins, even though it is the core infrastructure of your erxes project. 


### Plugins


erxes plugins contains a wide range of concept, which are:

- Core plugins play a role as features that can independently operate to fulfill their purposes. 
- More plugins are the tools to extend the functionalities of core plugins. They offer specific functions and features so that users can customize their plugins to their specific needs.


### Add-ons


Add-ons are the third-party softwares that can be integrated and work with the erxes Inbox & Contact plugins. 


All plugins and add-ons are available on <a href="https://erxes.io/marketplace">**our marketplace**</a> for you to learn and intsall after youâ€™ve finished installing erxes XOS if youâ€™re on the self-hosted version or youâ€™ll have it already if you're on our SaaS version.
