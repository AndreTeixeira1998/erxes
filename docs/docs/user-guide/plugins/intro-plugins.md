erxes plugins contain a wide range of concepts at erxes that can play a major role as features that can independently operate to fulfill their purposes.

You can create your own plugin using **<a href="https://docs.erxes.io/docs/developer/developing-plugins" >the guideline</a>**  and place it on **<a href="https://erxes.io/marketplace" >our marketplace</a>** to generate more income for yourself.

:::

Every default erxes XOS code comes with the following pre-installed plugins:

- System configuration
- Permission
- Team members
- Brands
- Import/Export
- Apps
- Marketplace

These plugins are essential for your erxes XOS to function and cannot be uninstalled, though technically you can not do anything with them on their own. So you need to install additional plugins available at erxes marketplace from erxes global profile. This section focuses on how to install and manage these plugins. At this moment, we have 30+ plugins available on our marketplace right now, and more plugins will be added daily. From the admin panel, administrators are allowed to:

- discover additional plugins and providers in the Marketplace 
- review the currently installed plugins and providers in Plugins

## Providers

Providers are the companies or individuals who developed and placed the particular plugins at erxes Marketplace.
