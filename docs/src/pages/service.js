              Scales With <span className={styles.colorPrimary}>your Budget</span>
              </h2>
              <p>
              One of the major benefits of open source software is that acquisition and deployment costs are generally much lower as you are not obliged to pay licensing fees. 
              Cutting costs is extremely important to start-up and smaller companies as the budget that would have been spent on software licensing can be utilized where it is needed. 
              </p>
              <p>For those that are utilizing open source software and wish to expand and scale up it is possible to move from the community version to the commercial version. This means that companies and organizations can test alternatives and pick and choose the one that suits their needs before having to spend any money on licensing. 
              </p>

                    <h4>Community based</h4>
                    <p className={styles.smallDesc}>
                      Open source projects are often community driven and rely on the collective to progress their development. As these projects are supported by a large group of developers and supporters the speed of development can be quicker than proprietary software. <br /> <br /> The number of people involved can provide extensive testing and troubleshooting. Such projects can often have thousands of developers working on it concurrently, whereas only the largest proprietary project can match this.

                    <h4>Reliable and secure</h4>
                    <p className={styles.smallDesc}>
                Security and reliability walk hand in hand with the community of developers supporting the project. Unlike proprietary software, anybody can review crowdsourced software and close gaps in security. <br /> <br />  The community as a whole review the code and are constantly testing to ensure that the software is as reliable as possible.

                    <h4>Trust and transparency</h4>
                    <p className={styles.smallDesc}>
              Open source projects are by nature transparent so as to further development. <br /> <br />  This nature allows developers from around the world to work on the project and increase itâ€™s security thereby increasing the trust that people have for the project.
